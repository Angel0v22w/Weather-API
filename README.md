# Weather-API
This program gets the weather for five random cities. It shows the coldest city, minimal temeprture, average temperture for the five random generated cities.
# Task 1
Created with python, pandas for the csv file from where I get the cities.
# Task 2 
Task 2 is the same but I added GUI with Tkinter. You can also search for a specific city.
# Task 3 
Here I create it with Flask, Bootstrap, CSS.
# Task 4 
Here I used Django instead of Flask.
